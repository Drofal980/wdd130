        <p>My name is Brandon Van Blarcum and I'm from Colorado. I'm a student at BYU-Idaho studying Software Development.</p>
        <p>
            I love to tinker, whether it be my bike, my car, or any electronic, I love fixing anything. 
            I am taking this course to learn more about organizing and designing websites to help me become a full-stack developer.
            I've been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints my whole life. I served a mission in Long Beach and Anaheim, California.
            When I was on my mission, I learned to love the Book of Mormon as I studied it. One of my favorite verses is Alma 7:11-13

                And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people.
                And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to csuccor his people according to their infirmities.
                Now the Spirit knoweth all things; nevertheless the Son of God suffereth according to the flesh that he might take upon him the sins of his people, that he might blot out their transgressions according to the power of his deliverance; and now behold,
